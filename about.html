												<h2>My Student Life</h2>
											</header>

											<p><b>I have been, and am currently studying at the University of Antique Tario Lim Memorial Campus Laboratory High School from 7th grade to present. The reason why I chose this school is because it is what I believe to be the most suitable school for me in the local area. My father was also a former professor in Accountancy. The friends that I have met here in school are ones that I do not regret having. They have aided me in times that I needed them the most. </p>

												<h2>My Future Plans</h3>
											<p>For my Senior High School term, I will be going under the strand of Accountancy and Business Management. I am still contemplating about what major I am going to choose. My top choices are either Financial Management, Accountancy, Entrepreneurship, and Mathematics. I yearn to be a Financial Advisor first and foremost, as I am absolutely enamoured by the beauty of investing and finances. As a secondary goal, I also want to help run our business more effectively to help my parents and prepare for the next generation.</p>

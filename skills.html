												<h3>MTAP Experience</h3>
												<p>Ever since 1st grade I have developed a great interest to mathematics. With that in mind, it urged me to enter math competitions. I have climbed up to the provincial level from 1st to 6th grade until I stopped entering such competitions due to the lack of motivation and newly found interests.</p>
